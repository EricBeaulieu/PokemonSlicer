    How it works if you must select the root texture of the sprites. (Such as GEN1SPRITE)

    Once you select that object just go under tools that should be at the top of the project and select organize pokemon art, 
    once you go into that it shall show numbers asking the starting number and the end number. Once that's all done you select 
    the button at the bottom and it will automatically slice everything for you. 
    it takes a bit of time to load, but the 2 minute wait is worth it compared to how much time it is saving.
    If you want to do the second-gen all you have to do is select the 2nd gen sheet and their numbers inside of it and it 
    shall slice accordingly. Unknown will still product but he is an empty slot, the reasoning is he has multiple forms, due to this he
    has his own sprite sheet.

    For some reason atm there is a bug when slicing the second sheet, just slice it again and it will correct itselft, I have no idea 
    whats causing this ATM but doing it a second time will fix it.

    The folder with Test sprites have sprites that have been untouched for the user to test it on, the original ones have everything 
    presliced already to show a final result

    If there are any issues don't be afraid to let me know.
